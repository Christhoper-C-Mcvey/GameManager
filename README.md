# GameManager
A Game Manager for newton
This was a easy application that that took a long time to put together primarly because of setup issues on a machine not used for any development.
I had to mostly restart yesterday because of hardware failure and managed to get the bulk of it in.  All the api's work but I am getting an CORS policy issue on my insert and update which should be easy to correct.
I was intersesting to build this from the start and I know there are a 1000 improvements that could and should be made if this was a final product.  I wanted to submit something to show I was earnest in my interest and I thank you for the opertunty to put it together.
